  blurb: Tenure-track scientist at NIOZ Texel in the Department of Ocean Systems (OCS) since November 2019.  Interested in the changing biogeochemistry of the modern ocean, with a focus on CO<sub>2</sub>.  Conducts ocean-going, observation-based research alongside theoretical studies of the marine carbonate system and develops related scientific software.  Previously based in the UK at the universities of Cambridge (undergrad), Southampton (PhD and postdoc), and East Anglia (postdoc).

  blurb: PhD student at NIOZ Texel in the Department of Ocean Systems (OCS) since February 2020.  My project explores blindspots in the marine carbon cycle with a focus on how the ocean responds to increasing anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, especially in under-sampled regions such as the southern Indian and Pacific Oceans.  I use scientific programming to investigate new measurements in combination with already existing datasets.  MSc from McGill University (Canada).
