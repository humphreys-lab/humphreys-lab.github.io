  blurb: Tenure-track scientist at NIOZ Texel in the Department of Ocean Systems (OCS) since November 2019.  Interested in the changing biogeochemistry of the modern ocean, with a focus on CO<sub>2</sub>.  Conducts ocean-going, observation-based research alongside theoretical studies of the marine carbonate system and develops related scientific software.  Previously based in the UK at the universities of Cambridge (undergrad), Southampton (PhD and postdoc), and East Anglia (postdoc).

  blurb: PhD student at NIOZ Texel in the Department of Ocean Systems (OCS) since February 2020.  My project explores blindspots in the marine carbon cycle with a focus on how the ocean responds to increasing anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, especially in under-sampled regions such as the southern Indian and Pacific Oceans.  I use scientific programming to investigate new measurements in combination with already existing datasets.  MSc from McGill University (Canada).

  blurb: PhD student at NIOZ Texel in the Department of Ocean Systems (OCS) since August 2021.  My research project aims at exploring and better understanding the human impact, especially infrastructure development such as offshore wind farms, on the carbonate system (mainly the pH) in the North Sea. The project is carried out through a combination of laboratory studies and high-resolution autonomous CO<sub>2</sub> system sensors that will be deployed in the Sea. MSc from the Mediterranean Institute of Oceanography (France).

  blurb: PhD student at NIOZ (Texel) and Utrecht University since February 2022 After jumping from organometallic and computational chemistry during my BSc at the University of Tübingen (Germany) to atmospheric chemistry at Cambridge University (UK), I now ended up in chemical oceanography.  I am interested in the dissolution of calcium carbonate in the water column.  Specifically, my project aims to identify drivers of dissolution apart from the saturation state, through field and lab experiments as well as modelling approaches.

#   blurb: I am Simen, an Applied Physics master student from the University of Twente. During my six-month internship at NIOZ, I will investigate marine alkalinity using the Water Mass Transformation Framework, thus combining the areas of expertise of my supervisors Matthew Humphreys and Sjoerd Groeskamp.  Initially, we will focus on global alkalinity budgets and shift to local scales when time permits.

#  blurb: "I am Cecile, an Earth, Life and Climate master student at Utrecht University. The most exciting thing about my half-year research is that I hope to understand why the pH is increasing in the Dutch coastal zone since 2010. I could not find a more inspiring environment than NIOZ, where you meet people with the same interests and live on a bird paradise island: Texel. The goal of my research is to discover the processes responsible for the long-term pH trend of the Dutch coastal zone. I will look at satellite images for algal blooms, plot different parameters with Python to find relationships between biogeochemical processes and the CO<sub>2</sub> and compare the Rijkswaterstaat dataset with other datasets. In my free time I like to make my own postcards and jewellery. Furthermore, I play field hockey in the weekends, try to learn ukulele and dance/sing whenever possible!"
