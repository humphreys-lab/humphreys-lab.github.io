#### NIOZ Texel

##### Completed PhD students

  * L. Delaigue (2024).  Filling the gaps: Anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> and the changing biological carbon pump through integrated observations and machine learning.

##### Masters research projects

Masters guided research projects and theses for students from various Dutch universities (VU, UU, UT, WUR) (co-)supervised at the NIOZ since 2021:

  * The effect of the Agulhas rings on the biogeochemistry in the South Atlantic Ocean.
  * The role of organic matter in total alkalinity of the Wadden Sea.
  * Anthropogenic carbon in the Atlantic Ocean at 40 Â°S from 1972 to 2014.
  * pH dynamics in the North Sea.
  * Computation of global calcium carbonate dissolution from diapycnal alkalinity transport.
  * Predicting the marine carbonate system in the surface of the Southern Bight of the North Sea: based on extreme gradient boosting models.
  * The carbonate system on the long-term in the Dutch coastal zone: ocean acidification in reverse?
  * Effects of seawater composition on the dissociation of carbonic acid.
  * Seasonal and inter-annual variability of pH and relevant biogeochemical cycles along the Dutch coastal zone.
  * Ocean acidification and air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> exchange in the Dutch North Sea.

#### University of Southampton

Masters research projects supervised by Matthew Humphreys at the University of Southampton from 2011 to 2017:

  * Accumulation of anthropogenic carbon and acidification of Northeast Atlantic water masses.
  *  Variability of marine carbonate chemistry in the Benguela upwelling region, South Atlantic.
  * Controls on the equatorial Pacific as a source of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere using data from the Surface Ocean CO<sub>2</sub> Atlas (SOCAT).
  * The stable isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon and anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake in the subpolar North Atlantic during summer 2014.
  * Multi-decadal changes in interior carbonate chemistry in the South Atlantic.
  * The northwest European continental shelf in the Surface Ocean CO<sub>2</sub> Atlas (SOCAT).
  * Surface carbonate chemistry in the Chukchi Sea, Arctic Ocean.
  * Latitudinal gradients in surface ocean CO<sub>2</sub> chemistry across the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean.
  * Marine carbonate chemistry and nutrients on the Extended Ellett Line transect, Northeast Atlantic Ocean.
